Smart Resume Analyzer API

ðŸ“– Overview
The Smart Resume Analyzer API is an AI-powered backend service designed to streamline the hiring process by analyzing resumes against job descriptions. It parses PDF resumes, extracts skills using NLP, and evaluates compatibility through skills matching, keyword density, and semantic similarity. The API returns a detailed report with scores and actionable suggestions to improve the resume, making it valuable for HR professionals and job seekers.
Built with modern Python tools and containerized with Docker, this project is scalable, easy to deploy, and ready for integration into larger HR tech solutions.
âœ¨ Features

Resume Parsing: Extracts text from PDF resumes using PyMuPDF.
Skills Extraction: Identifies skills with spaCy and a predefined skills database.
Job Description Matching: Computes skills match and semantic similarity using SentenceTransformers.
Keyword Density Analysis: Measures the presence of job-relevant keywords.
Actionable Suggestions: Provides feedback (e.g., "Add experience in Python").
RESTful API: Built with FastAPI for high performance and easy integration.
Docker Support: Containerized for deployment on platforms like Render or Railway.
